## Prerequisites Checklist

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- [ ] MyStation device with e-paper display
- [ ] USB-C cable
- [ ] Computer with internet access (for initial firmware upload, if needed)
- [ ] WiFi network (2.4 GHz only - **5 GHz is not supported**)
- [ ] Your WiFi password

> ⚠️ **Important**: MyStation only works with **2.4 GHz WiFi networks**. 5 GHz networks are not supported due to higher
> energy consumption.

## Step 1: Power On Your Device (1 minute)

### First Power-On

1. **Connect USB-C cable** to your MyStation device
2. **Plug into computer** or USB power adapter
3. **Display will initialize** - you'll see the e-paper flash/update

   MyStation-XXXXXXXX
   ```
   (XXXXXXXX is your device's unique ID)

2. **Connect to this network**
    - No password required
    - You may see a "No Internet" warning - this is normal

3. **Configuration portal should appear automatically**
    - If not, open your browser and go to: `http://10.0.1.1`

## Step 3: Configure Your WiFi (3 minutes)

### Connect MyStation to Your Home Network

1. **On the configuration page**, you'll see a list of available WiFi networks

2. **Select your home WiFi network**
    - ⚠️ **Make sure it's a 2.4 GHz network** (not 5 GHz)
    - Check signal strength indicator
    - If you don't see your network, click "Scan" to refresh

3. **Enter your WiFi password**
    - Password is case-sensitive
    - Make sure Caps Lock is off

4. **Click "Connect" or "Save"**

5. **Wait for confirmation**
    - Device will attempt to connect
    - May take 10-30 seconds
    - Display will show connection status

**If connection fails:**

- Double-check password
- Verify network is 2.4 GHz (not 5 GHz)
- Move device closer to router
- See [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md#cannot-connect-mystation-to-home-wifi)

## Step 4: Station Configuration (5 minutes)

### Access Configuration Interface

After WiFi setup, your device will:

1. Connect to your WiFi network
2. Automatically detect your location
3. Find nearby public transport stops
4. Start a configuration web server

**Access the configuration page:**

### Configure Your Location

The device will automatically:

1. ✅ Detect your approximate location using Google Geolocation
2. ✅ Display your city and coordinates
3. ✅ Find nearby transport stops

**If needed, you can:**

    - ☐ Uncheck types you don't use

### Display Settings

Configure how your information is displayed:

**Update Interval**: How often to refresh data

- **5 minutes** (default) - Good balance of freshness and battery life
- **10 minutes** - Less frequent updates, better battery
- **15 minutes** - Best battery life, still useful
- Shorter intervals = fresher data but shorter battery life

**Display Mode**: What to show on screen

- **Weather + Departures** (default) - Split view, see both
- **Weather Only** - Full screen weather
- **Departures Only** - Full screen departures
- You can change this anytime with the buttons

**Sleep Schedule** (Optional): Set quiet hours

- Example: Sleep from 23:00 to 06:00

- Automatically resumes in the morning

### Save Configuration

1. **Review your settings**
2. **Click "Save Settings"**
3. **Wait for confirmation message**
4. **Device will restart** and begin normal operation

## Step 5: Verify Operation (2 minutes)

### Check the Display

Your e-paper display should now show:

**In Weather + Departures mode:**

- 🌤️ Current weather (top section)
- 🚌 Upcoming departures (bottom section)
- ⏰ Last update time (footer)
- 🔋 Battery status (footer)

**Update Process:**
You'll see the display refresh:

1. Screen flashes (black/white) - this is normal for e-paper
2. Takes 30-45 seconds to fully update
3. New information appears
4. Device goes to sleep until next update

### Normal Operation Cycle

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Sleep] -->|Wake Timer| B[Connect WiFi]
    B --> C[Fetch Weather]
    C --> D[Fetch Departures]
    D --> E[Update Display]
    E --> A
    style A fill: #e1ffe1
    style E fill: #ffe1e1
```

Your MyStation will:

1. **Wake up** at your configured interval (e.g., every 5 minutes)
2. **Connect** to your WiFi network
3. **Fetch** latest weather and departure data
4. **Update** the e-paper display
5. **Sleep** to save battery

This happens automatically - no intervention needed!

## Using the Physical Buttons

Your MyStation has 3 buttons for quick control:

**Button 1** (Left): Weather + Departures view
**Button 2** (Middle): Weather only view
**Button 3** (Right): Departures only view

**To change display mode:**

1. Press the button for the view you want
2. Device wakes up immediately
3. Fetches fresh data
4. Updates display to show requested view
5. After 2 minutes, returns to configured mode

**Long press Button 1** (5 seconds during power-on): Factory reset

See [Button Controls](button-controls.md) for detailed usage.

## Battery Installation (Optional)

### For Wireless Operation

1. **Power off** the device (unplug USB)
2. **Connect LiPo battery** to the JST connector
    - Match polarity: Red to red, black to black
    - Connector only fits one way
3. **Power on** and verify operation
4. **Unplug USB** for battery-only operation

### Battery Life Expectations

With a 2000mAh battery:

- **5-minute updates**: 2-4 weeks
- **10-minute updates**: 4-8 weeks
- **15-minute updates**: 6-12 weeks

**Tips for longer battery life:**

- Increase update interval to 10-15 minutes
- Enable sleep schedule (no updates overnight)
- Ensure strong WiFi signal (weak signal uses more power)
